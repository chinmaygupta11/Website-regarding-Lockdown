	<h3> Let me introduce you, the topic which is very famous nowadays. The word which really haunts every busineesman & keeps it tough for the young people. Yes you have gueesed it right. It's lockdown. Let us look deep into the situation created due to lockdown & it's effects on the people. Let us understand in depth. </h3>
	
	<h3> <ul> <li> Background </li></ul> </h3>
	<div class="box-3">
	<p1> The Government of India confirmed India's first case of Coronavirus disease 2019 on 30 January 2020 in the state of Kerala, when a university student from Wuhan travelled back to the state. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases closed 500, Modi on 19 March, asked all citizens to observe 'Janata Curfew' (people's curfew) on Sunday, 22 March. At the end of the curfew, Modi stated: "Janata Curfew is just the beginning of a long battle against COVID-19". Following this, while addressing the nation second time on 24 March, he announced the nationwide lockdown from midnight of that day, for a period of 21 days. He said that the only solution to control the spread of coronavirus was to break the cycle of transmission through social distancing. He also added that the lockdown would be enforced more strictly than the Janata Curfew. </p1> </div> 

	<div class="category2">
	    <h3> <ul> <li> Janta Curfew </li></ul> </h3>
	<p1> The Janata Curfew (transl. People's curfew) was a 14-hour curfew on 22 March (from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.). Every person was required to obey the curfew, with exceptions for people of "essential services" such as police, medical services, media, home delivery professionals and firefighters. At 5 p.m. that day, all citizens were asked to stand in their doorways, balconies or windows, and clap their hands or ring their bells in appreciation for the professionals delivering these essential services. People belonging to National Cadet Corps and National Service Scheme were to enforce the curfew in the country. The Prime Minister also urged the youth to inform 10 others about Janata Curfew and encourage everyone to observe the curfew. </p1> </div>

	 <h3> Let us look at the Timeline of this particular lockdown:- </h3> 

	<div class="category1">
	 <h4> <ul> <li> <a href = "C:\Users\Chinmay Gupta\Desktop\Work\Project1\Phase1.html" target="_blank" > Phase 1 (25 March – 14 April) </a> </li></ul> </h4> 

	 <h4> <ul> <li> <a href = "C:\Users\Chinmay Gupta\Desktop\Work\Project1\Phase2.html" target="_blank" > Phase 2 (15 April – 3 May) </a> </li> </ul> </h4> 

	 <h4> <ul> <li> <a href = "C:\Users\Chinmay Gupta\Desktop\Work\Project1\Phase3.html" target="_blank" > Phase 3 (4–17 May) </a> </li> </ul> </h4> 

	 <h4> <ul> <li> <a href = "C:\Users\Chinmay Gupta\Desktop\Work\Project1\Phase4.html" target="_blank" > Phase 4 (18–31 May) </a> </li> </ul> </h4> </div>

	<div class="con1">
		<h3> <center> <ul> <li> Impact </li> </ul> </center> </h3>
	 <p1> Food delivery services were banned by several state governments despite the central government's approval. Thousands of people emigrated out of major Indian cities, as they became jobless after the lockdown. Following the lockdown, India's electricity demand fell down to a five-month low on 28 March. The lockdown broke the supply chain of narcotics in Punjab. Many states were keen on opening up liquor shops during the lockdown which was finally allowed in the 3rd phase beginning on 4 May. Reports of a surge in illicit liquor sales and most importantly, drying up of revenue from liquor sale was the main stimulation. Due to the lockdown, more than 350 deaths were reported as of 10 May with reasons ranging from starvation, suicides, exhaustion, road and rail accidents, police brutality and denial of timely medical care. Among the reported deaths most were among the marginalised migrants and labourers.</p1> </div>

	<div class="con2"> 
	 	<h3> <center> <ul> <li> Economic Impact </li> </ul> </center> </h3> 
	<p1> India had already been experiencing a prolonged economic slowdown. The GDP growth rate had fallen from 8.2% in January–March 2018 to 3.1% in January–March 2020. In the first quarter of the financial year 2020-2021, this number went into negative. The GDP growth rate for April–June 2020 was -23.9%, which happened to be the worst ever in history. Crucial parameters like manufacturing, construction, trade, hotel industry saw a decline and slid into negative. Manufacturing growth at -39.3%, Mining growth at -23.3%, Construction growth at -50%, Trade & hotel industry growth at -47%. </p1> </div> 

	 <div class = con3> <h3> <ul> <li> Food Supply Chain </li> </ul> </h3> 
	 <p1> The order issued by the Home Ministry on 24 March allowed the functioning of shops dealing with food items as well as the manufacturing units and transportation of "essential goods". However, the lack of clarity on "essential goods" meant that the policemen on the streets stopped workers going to factories and the trucks carrying food items. Food industries also faced shortages of labour because the workers were unable to reach workplaces and the factory managers faced the fear of legal action. All these factors combined to result in shortages and a raise in the prices of food items. By the first week of April, essential industries such as growing, harvesting and food deliveries were allowed to operate. </p1> </div> </div>

	 <div> <h3> <ul> <li> Relief </li> </ul> </h3> 
	 <p1> On 26 March 2020, the Indian government announced a relief package of $22.6 billion to assist the poor population hit economically by the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan was to benefit the migrant workers through cash transfers and initiatives for food security. However, on 9 April 2020, economists and activists argued that a significant proportion of the affected population was unable to avail the facilities. Only those registered with the federal food welfare scheme were able to secure benefits.According to a Government of India as of 7 April, state governments operated 22,567 relief camps for stranded migrant workers, of which 15,541 were operated by Kerala, 1,135 camps by Maharashtra, 178 camps by Tamil Nadu and smaller numbers by other states. Non-governmental organisations operating 3,909 camps. On 12 May, Modi announced that the government would provide 20 trillion rupees in support package in fiscal and monetary measures to support the economy. </p1> </div>

	 <h3> After phase4, the Government of India announced to start unlocking after looking at the economic downfall. Let us see the situation in the unlock process. </h3> 

	 <div class = "category1"> <h4> <ul> <li> <a href= "C:\Users\Chinmay Gupta\Desktop\Work\Project1\Unlock1.html" target="_blank" > Unlock 1.0 (1–30 June) </a> </li> </ul> </h4> 

	 <h4> <ul> <li> <a href="C:\Users\Chinmay Gupta\Desktop\Work\Project1\Unlock2.html" target="_blank" > Unlock 2.0 (1–31 July) </a> </li> </ul> </h4> 

	 <h4> <ul> <li> <a href="C:\Users\Chinmay Gupta\Desktop\Work\Project1\Unlock3.html" target="_blank" > Unlock 3.0 (1–31 August) </a></li> </ul> </h4> 

	 <h4> <ul> <li> <a href="C:\Users\Chinmay Gupta\Desktop\Work\Project1\Unlock4.html" target="_blank" > Unlock 4.0 (1-30 September) </a> </li> </ul> </h4> </div> 

	 <div ><h3> <ul> <li> Migrant Workers </li> </ul> </h3> 
	 <p1> With factories and workplaces shut down, millions of migrant workers had to deal with the loss of income, food shortages and uncertainty about their future. Following this, many of them and their families went hungry. While government schemes ensured that the poor would get additional rations due to the lockdown, the distribution system failed to be effective. With no work and no money, thousands of migrant workers were seen walking or bicycling hundreds of kilometres to go back to their native villages. Many were arrested for violating the lockdown and some died of exhaustion or in accidents on the roads. On 29 March, the government ordered landlords to not demand rent and employers to pay wages without deduction. It also announced that those who violated the lockdown were to be sent to government-run quarantine facilities for 14 days. In its report to the Supreme Court of India on 31 March, the central government stated that the migrant workers, apprehensive about their survival, moved in the panic created by fake news that the lockdown would last for more than three months. In late March, the Uttar Pradesh government decided to arrange buses at Delhi's Anand Vihar bus station to take the migrants back to their villages for free. Migrants across the country remained stranded till the last week of April, when the state governments were finally permitted by the central government to operate buses, but not trains. On 1 May, the central government allowed the Indian Railways to launch "Shramik Special" trains for the migrant workers and others stranded. Due to lack of coordination between originating states and railways, there were reports claiming that migrants were being charged for the train tickets. The government faced criticism from the opposition. The Railways later clarified that it was bearing 85% of the total cost of running and the rest 15% which makes up the ticket fare was being borne by the originating states. Despite the launching of special trains and buses by the government, the migrant workers chose to either travel together in large groups. They did not wait their turn to board the government-arranged transport, mainly due to starvation and eagerness to reach their homes soon. Additionally, they felt that going back to their hometowns, they could return to farming and take up small jobs under the MNREGA. On 26 May, the Supreme Court admitted that the problems of the migrants had still not been solved and that there had been "inadequacies and certain lapses" on the part of the governments. It thus ordered the Centre and States to provide free food, shelter and transport to stranded migrant workers. </p1> </div> <br>
