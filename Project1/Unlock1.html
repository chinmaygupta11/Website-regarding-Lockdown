<p1> The MHA issued fresh guidelines for the month of June, stating that the phases of reopening would "have an economic focus". Lockdown restrictions were only be imposed in containment zones, while activities were permitted in other zones in a phased manner. This first phase of reopening was termed as "Unlock 1.0" and permitted shopping malls, religious places, hotels and restaurants to reopen from 8 June. Large gatherings were still banned, but there were no restrictions on inter-state travel. Night curfews were in effect from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. in all areas and state governments were allowed to impose suitable restrictions on all activities. In future phases of reopening, further activities are to be permitted. In Phase II, all educational institutions are scheduled to reopen in July, pending consultations with state governments. In Phase III, easing of restrictions on international air travel, operation of metros and recreational activities (swimming pools, gymnasiums, theatres, entertainment parks, bars, auditoriums and assembly halls) would be decided upon in August. </p1>
